NAME Junior Barbarian
SYMB p
COLOR YELLOW
DESC
This is a junior barbarian.  He--or is it she?  You can't tell for sure--
looks like... it should still be in barbarian school.  The barbarians are
putting them in the dungeons young these days.  It's wearing dirty, tattered
cloth armor and wielding a wooden sword.  You have a hard time feeling
intimidated.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Amazon Lich Queen
DESC
She was a powerful Amazon warrior in life.  Death at the hands of the undead
hordes was followed by her resurrection through dark, necromantic arts.  Her
power in life didn't approach her undead glory.  Clad in night-black robes
that don't move in the wind, her incorporeal form commands the power of death
over life.  You may just be her next victim.  You fear for your soul as you
quake before her malevolent majesty.

All decked out in a brand new Chilton uniform, she talks faster than anybody
you've ever known.  She's dual-wielding Proust's "Rememberance of Things

with a litany of cultural references from which you'll never recover.

Casper, the friendly ghost,
The friendliest ghost you know.
